         Eliver is a senior costume designer currently working for the University of Pittsburgh on their Spring season. Together with their collegues in the costume shop, they work to bring to life both their own designs, and the designs of others to life on Pitt's stages. Currently designing 'The Brown Overcoat' by Victor Sejour, directed by Howard Patterson, their work will debut at the end of the month of February 2026 on the 27th, 28th, and March 1st.
